Yet, it still takes more than 12 years to develop a drug. Today thousands of diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people have no effective treatment. Accelerating the pace of discovering and developing effective medicines to patients is one of the greatest opportunities for humanity.Our mission is to develop better drugs, faster. Our team has built a full-stack drug discovery platform centered around one of the largest human multi-omics databases. We use machine learning to map network relationships between complex causes of disease, and then leverage a wide range of systems biology approaches to find new druggable intervention points. Drug candidates are developed to the clinic using our internal biology and chemistry platforms. We are developing new drugs to treat some of the biggest medical challenges today: ALS, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Crohn\u2019s Disease, and inflammatory skin diseases. Our first drug for ALS is currently in human trials, and it was discovered entirely using our platform.We raised $134M from top tier investors (e.g. BlackRock, Eli Lilly, Merck, Section 32, Threshold Ventures, Y Combinator, etc) and in 2021 we announced a $706M deal with Eli Lilly. We are a team of data scientists, neuroscientists, and drug developers united around an audacious vision to make drug discovery cheaper and faster.ResponsibilitiesOperate Verge's computational platform (CONVERGE) to go from raw human -omics data to prioritized targets for selected neurological diseases.Act as a disease area expert, synthesize biomedical literature and data insights to develop the prioritization of predicted targets for validation and drug discovery activities.Landscape public -omics and human genetics data sources and curate study metadata specific to disease indications.Analyze transcriptomic and other data types to select relevant model systems and assess effects on model systems following target modulation.Work closely with the leadership of Translational Genomics to define and execute on a strategy that drives innovation in target identification, incorporation of new data layers, and expansion into biomarker discovery and patient enrichment strategies.Develop productive collaborations with Computational Biology, Target Validation, Drug Discovery, Chemistry, Translational Biomarkers, and Clinical Development teams and ensure efficient data utilization across functional areas.Develop and maintain external relationships (CROs, partnerships, collaborations) to augment and extend Translational Genomics capabilities.Consistent with Verge values and behaviors, foster a culture of transparency, open communication, accountability, and innovation.Advocate for your career development in the Translational Genomics group and help lift the performance of other team members.RequirementsPh.D. with 5-8 years experience post-degree in computational biology, bioinformatics, data science or related fields (pre- & post-PhD employment will be evaluated).Fluency of standard tools in a computational and statistical toolbox (e.g. Python, R, github, unix/linux environments, high performance computing in the cloud).Direct experience with target prioritization or biomarker identification focused on neurological diseases, with a working knowledge of statistical genetics.The ability to mine the literature record and relevant databases (e.g. tissue and single cell expression, CRISPR screens, Gene Expression Omnibus, druggability, human genetics) to annotate targets and synthesize therapeutic hypotheses for prioritization.A working knowledge of the in vitro assays and animal models used to validate prioritized targets, as well as high throughput functional genomics screens (e.g. CRISPR, Perturb-Seq).Excellent communication skills. Able to convey technical concepts across diverse internal and external audiences.Flexible mindset and resilient. Adjusts easily to new or changing circumstances. Able to quickly recover from challenges and pivot in a solution-oriented fashion.Start up fit: a sense of urgency with creative problem solving. Thrives in an ambitious, fast-paced environment with changing priorities.Deep alignment with our values and/or a passion for learning and practicing conscious leadership.A passion for making an impact on patients.Compensation & Benefits At Verge GenomicsOur target starting salary for successful US-based applicants for this role will vary from $ 140,000 to $160,000 depending upon the skillset and experience of the candidate.

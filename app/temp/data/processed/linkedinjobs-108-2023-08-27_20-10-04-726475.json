You\u2019ll work closely with our diverse engineering team to build multi-omics analysis software that radically unlocks the time, cost, and usability of our drug discovery methods. Join us!Who We AreTechnology has transformed almost every single aspect of our lives. Yet, it still takes more than 12 years to develop a drug. Today thousands of diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people have no effective treatment. Accelerating the pace of discovering and developing effective medicines to patients is one of the greatest opportunities for humanity.Our mission is to develop better drugs, faster. Our team has built a full-stack drug discovery platform centered around one of the largest human multi-omics databases. We use machine learning to map network relationships between complex causes of disease, and then leverage a wide range of systems biology approaches to find new druggable intervention points. Drug candidates are developed to the clinic using our internal biology and chemistry platforms. We are developing new drugs to treat some of the biggest medical challenges today: ALS, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Crohn\u2019s Disease, and inflammatory skin diseases. Our first drug for ALS is currently in human trials, and it was discovered entirely using our platform.We raised $134M from top tier investors (e.g. BlackRock, Eli Lilly, Merck, Section 32, Threshold Ventures, Y Combinator, etc) and in 2021 we announced a $706M deal with Eli Lilly. We are a team of data scientists, neuroscientists, and drug developers united around an audacious vision to make drug discovery cheaper and faster.Who You AreThe mission for this role is to build bioinformatics software that radically unlocks the time, cost, and usability of drug discovery methods at Verge Genomics.

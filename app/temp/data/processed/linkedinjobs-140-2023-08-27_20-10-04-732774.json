Candidates anywhere in the US are encouraged to apply.About Us:Ambience Healthcare is building the AI operating system for healthcare, with the mission of supercharging healthcare workers with AI superpowers.Over the past several years, healthcare organizations and health systems have been approaching a critical turning point: workforce shortages and clinician burnout are at an all-time high, cutting into already-razor-thin margins and posing critical operational challenges. Organizations are finding themselves under immense pressure to address burnout and increase access to care, all while maintaining profitability despite declining reimbursement rates.Until now, they have been unable to find any viable solutions to this productivity and morale crisis.Ambience Healthcare was founded after 2.5 years of R&D in large language model (LLM) technology to address one of the most impactful productivity opportunities in healthcare: clinical documentation. The most painful part of a clinician's day consists of hours of late-night administrative work, writing detailed documentation in the medical record for each of their visits. The contents of each medical note are critical for reimbursement, compliance, downstream clinical quality measures, and for other care team members to understand what happened to each patient.Ambience's flagship product, Ambience AutoScribe, is a best-in-class AI medical scribe that captures the nuances of clinician-patient conversation in real-time into comprehensive medical documentation within the EMR. On average, Ambience saves 16+ hours of tedious note-taking per clinician per week. Today, AutoScribe is available across 18+ specialties and is used by clinicians at leading healthcare organizations for every single one of their shifts.For the first time in years, clinicians are able to get home on time for dinner without any documentation homework. And as a result, they now refuse to practice without AutoScribe.As we experience unprecedented pull from the market for our products, we're actively expanding our team of world-class talent across sales, marketing, product, engineering, clinical, and customer success functions.At Ambience, you'll be surrounded by an exceptional team of A-players who are kind, humble, curious, and deeply aligned with the core mission of improving the lives of clinicians and their patients, including:2nd-time founders in healthcare who previously built a virtual care platformthe author of a leading deep learning textbookco-founder of Cruise's ML platform teamco-founder of Rev.com's automated speech recognition teamFormer principal architect at PalantirFounder of Reddit's web platform teamformer Head of Growth from a leading tech-enabled primary care groupThe Role:As a Product Manager\u2014Clinical, your mission is to work closely with our machine learning team to fine-tune AI algorithms that produce high quality, billing-complete documentation that our providers love.

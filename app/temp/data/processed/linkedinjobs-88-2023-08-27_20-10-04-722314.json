We build software that helps people do what only they can do \u2013 give meaningData fills our modern world. It flows prolifically inside organizations, customer interactions, through product usage, environmental research, healthcare imaging, and beyond. What if we could use any of that historical data to predict the future? The fact is, in most cases we can make predictions through Machine Learning and AI, but to do so in a meaningful and impactful way, historical data needs to be accurate, comprehensive, and absent of bias.In order to make the best predictions, we believe internal teams with domain expertise should be responsible for annotating and curating data. It's called data labeling, and it's a process of real people giving meaning to the information they see on the screen. HumanSignal was founded to take data labeling to the next level.We believe that data labeling is a team sport. Data scientists, subject matter experts, engineers, operations, and annotators must work collaboratively to ensure quality results and an efficient process. That's why we created Label Studio, which has quickly become the most popular open source data labeling platform with a 250K+ users around the world and millions of labeled samples, alongside a community of thousands of data scientists sharing knowledge and working to advance data-centric AI.In late spring 2022, HumanSignal raised $25 million in Series A funding, bringing our total funds raised to $30 million from notable investment partners Redpoint Ventures, Unusual Ventures, Bow Capital, Swift Ventures, as well as angel investors.HumanSignal is a fully distributed organization with people all over the world.

The requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge, skill, and/or ability required. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.Michigan Technological University is an Equal Opportunity Educational Institution/Equal Opportunity Employer that provides equal opportunity for all, including protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.If you require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations to apply for employment, or for an interview, at Michigan Technological University, please notify the Human Resources office at 906-487-2280 or humanresources@mtu.edu .Job Description SummaryThe Research Scientist I \u2013 Remote Sensing position provides leadership and support for MTRI programs focused on the development and application of remote sensing and geospatial analysis to solve governmental and societal needs through sponsored research. Knowledge of remote sensing theory, including active and passive systems, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, microwave (SAR), and infrared sensing (IR); and an understanding of remote sensing application for environmental and/or Earth science research is required. The applicant will be expected to develop, select, apply for, and lead remote sensing research projects that apply their knowledge of sensing and image processing to research questions. The ability to improve the processing and analysis of remote sensing data through custom coding and analysis for land cover mapping, for example, will be important. Examples of current research areas include wildland and prescribed fire mapping and effects assessment, Great Lakes aquatic sensing, invasive species mapping, wetlands assessment, transportation infrastructure assessment, wildland fire danger and emissions mapping, cloud-based and distributed computing, user-friendly app development, improved geotemporal visualization of complex data and patterns, and extending airborne and/or UAV-enabling sensing. The position is based at MTRI in Ann Arbor, MI (https://mtu.edu/mtri).Essential Duties & Responsibilities (other Duties May Be Assigned) Develop, plan, and participate in research projects applying remote sensing, geospatial analysis, earth science knowledge, and analysis skills to solve project tasks for ongoing and new MTRI research projects, with the expectation of planning and coordinating research and development tasks in collaboration with other principal investigators. Lead teams and participate as an integral team member on multi-disciplinary research relating to applying technological skills to solving governmental and societal needs for a diverse set of current research areas, including improved remote sensing data analysis and visualization of complex data for environmental and interdisciplinary projects. Be able to deal with issues encountered in data processing and analysis to ensure scientifically valid data collection. Evaluate, select, and apply the results of data collected and research projects undertaken. Describe and share any concerns about the results or methodology and recommend or implement countermeasures. Contribute technical expertise in sensing at a primary and co-author level to specific aspects of conference presentations, journal articles, and technical reports, and be able to take the lead on preparing technical reports. The employee will be expected to exercise independent judgment using their expertise to help define how tasks will be completed, in coordination with project leaders, while being responsible for their own work. Lead and contribute to competitive proposals including development of specific tasks that use and exploit remote sensing data and products. Assess effectiveness of safety measures and training and implement necessary changes. Anticipate and recognize problems and potential problems at the individual and system levels. Recognize and respond appropriately to potential and actual unsafe situations. Apply safety-related knowledge, skills, and practices to everyday work. Commit to learning about continuous improvement strategies and applying them to everyday work. Encourage continuous improvement practices among employees.Required Education, Certifications, Licensures (minimum Requirements)PhD in remote sensing, geospatial technology, geography, computer science, computer engineering, physics, mathematics, earth science, ecology, or closely related field; OR Master\u2019s degree in remote sensing, geospatial technology, geography, computer science, computer engineering, physics, mathematics, earth science, ecology, or closely related field and at least 4 years of experience.Required Experience (minimum Requirements) Algorithm development with remote sensing technologies and data, including multi-spectral and/or hyperspectral and/or SAR, and/or thermal infrared (IR) imagery, for environmental applications.

Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, as well as our Code Search product, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We\u2019re building software that builds software, and in doing so we\u2019re making devs more productive and growing the population of coders by giving anybody access to the deep knowledge base of a senior engineer through Cody and all of the context it brings. We\u2019re preparing for a world with a lot more code than exists today, and that benefits us all.It\u2019s an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. AI has taken over the world, and we\u2019ve spent the last 10 years building infrastructure that\u2019s integral to making AI generated code more powerful and accurate. Our customers include 4/5 FAANG companies, 4 of the top 10 banks, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward. We\u2019ve raised $225M at a $2.625B valuation from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Redpoint, Craft and others. We\u2019re making ambitious bets on our future and we\u2019re looking to hire exceptional people to join our team as we make Sourcegraph one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world.Working hours\ud83c\udf0e Given that we are an all-remote company and hire almost anywhere in the world, we don\u2019t have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours.Why this job is excitingWe are creating a machine learning team at Sourcegraph, aimed at creating the most powerful coding assistant in the world. Many companies are trying, but Sourcegraph has a unique advantage: Our rich code graph. In the world of prompting LLMs, context is key, and for creating the right context, Sourcegraph\u2019s code data is simply the best you can get: IDE-quality, global-scale, and served lightning fast. Cody is already outperforming the pack, but we aim to take the lead in machine learning advancements on coding assistant quality. You can help us unlock Cody\u2019s full potential, delivering a product that accelerates development in a way we only see every 10-15 years.To head up this effort, we are looking for a seasoned and deeply technical ML-engineering leader, with a strong AI background and experience with both smaller models and the new LLM ecosystem, who can help us deliver the world\u2019s best coding assistant and ML-powered developer tooling. And if you happen to have an entrepreneurial streak, you\u2019re in luck: We have an enterprise distribution pipeline, so whatever you build can be deployed straight to enterprise customers with some of the largest codebases in the world, without all the go-to-market hassle you\u2019d encounter in a startup.Within one month, you will\u2026Meet your team, which consists initially of 3 to 5 ML engineers (2 already on the team) Start building a trusting relationship with your direct reports and peers. Come up to speed on the current state of machine learning in the Cody ecosystem. Be set up for local development and familiar with Cody\u2019s architecture. Define our short-term roadmap for ML Infrastructure on GCP. Ship a substantial feature, experiment, or evaluation. Within three months, you will\u2026Set up the at-scale infrastructure for running benchmarks that compare coding assistants. Have defined a strategy for how we will address getting GPUs at scale for various personas. Have defined a rough roadmap for how to cost-optimize our ML spend. Have defined our on-prem/self-hosted roadmap and recommended configurations for ML infra. Be up to speed and driving Sourcegraph\u2019s ML Infra strategy. Within six months, you will\u2026Have hired a world-class team of ML engineers. With the help of our research team, have delivered a ML-driven quality, benchmarking, and evaluation framework for coding assistants that runs at scale Have established a longer-term roadmap that keeps us aligned with expected advances in LLMs. Be running dozens to hundreds of experiments with prompting, embedding, fine-tuning and other techniques. About YouYou have been working squarely in ML Infra since LLMs landed, if not longer.You\u2019re deeply familiar with at least one end-to-end system for ML pipelines at scale, and you are broadly familiar with the competition in the space and what options are available, and when.In an ideal world, you are most deeply familiar with GCP\u2019s machine learning stack, and you have a lot of practice operationalizing PyTorch experiments on that stack. It\u2019s also great if you have Apache Spark in general.You should be the kind of person who lives and breathes GPUs, and you should come armed with opinions about how best to deploy and cost-optimize Cody for our various customer classes, from large enterprises to casual hackers, particularly when it comes to the Cloud-side deployments.In a perfect world, you would already be comfortable with options that enterprise customers might want for self-hosted ML infra, for running their own pipelines, e.g. other Cloud-hosted offerings, and/or OSS. Although we are pushing hard to have everything on GCP, the market is evolving rapidly and we could, for instance, come across customers who want to provide their own GPUs.Any familiarity you have with deploying enterprise SaaS is a huge bonus because it is a part of the role. However, it\u2019s something that you can pick up if you are already familiar with Cloud options.Bonus if you have any background in graph theory or anything that would be relevant to our code graph, which plays a key role in the production of both training data and in acting as a source of truth for verifying model outputs.We would love it if you are actively following developments in open-source models and training systems, and can come prepared with opinions about when and to what extent we should adopt them. Or more importantly, how we set up infrastructure that will tell us when they are ready, by evaluating their performance on Cody tasks.Best of all, we\u2019d love it if you already have an opinion about Cody, have tried it, and already have a vision for how you can help us make it even better!Level\ud83d\udcca This job is an M4.

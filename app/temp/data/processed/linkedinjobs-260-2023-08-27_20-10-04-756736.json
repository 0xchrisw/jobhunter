While this is not a people management role, you will be expected to lead technical program development and coordinate technical implementation plans with other technical team members. You will work closely with technical leads in other engineering groups to ensure our solutions enable functions that span our internal platforms, and you will work with functional leaders in our product, commercial, operations, and research teams. As a technical leader, you will be expected to practice methods that bring you and your software solutions close to the user with a deep understanding of their root cause problems and goals, and you will be comfortable ensuring other members of the team share this understanding.Your knowledge that spans contemporary methods in deep learning will allow you to develop and validate state of the art approaches to problems in computational genetics and other key operations areas of our diagnostics and decision support tools. You will work with other ML engineers implementing ML algorithms to accelerate and improve accuracy of our leading genetic interpretation system. Like your teammates, you will be able to implement every aspect of the technical stack, from cloud resource and infrastructure management to algorithmic development and validation to provisioning of APIs leveraged by our application engineer teams. You will work closely with product owners and clinical operations experts to understand the goals of our customers and expert scientist users, and you will be able to make independent decisions to improve the technical value of our systems for users with minimal guidance from your senior team members or management.You will be able to lead a technical effort of a squad of other ML engineers, computational biologist, and full-stack engineers, or work as a senior individual contributor working strategically to improve the team. You will be curious about emerging technologies and chose adoption of those tools carefully. As an engineering leader, you will help other teammates develop their skills and as an ML engineer, you will demonstrate the value of your specialty in the context of other engineering teams.Desired Traits: Good analytical and problem-solving skills Strong communication and collaboration abilities Resilience and the ability to pivot quickly in a rapidly changing field Empathy for both internal stakeholders and our customers Strong organizational and time management skillsSkills and Qualifications: Graduate degree in computer science, computational biology, or a related field Fundamentally strong knowledge of deep learning and other ML methods Familiarity with probabilistic graphic models, Bayesian DL, and common problems in computational biology 10+ years experience with production software development in industry Demonstrated expertise with deploying and managing AWS, GCP, or Azure, including Kubernetes, cloud-native tools, Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform), contemporary CI/CD practices (e.g. GitHub Actions), and observability (e.g. OpenTelemetry) Demonstrated expertise with production ML lifecycle tools (e.g. MLFlow, Kubeflow, Weights and Biases) Expert in Python, including Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, jax) Experience with NLP and familiarity with tools like SpaCy, HuggingFace Transformers; exposure to LLMOps tooling (e.g., LangChain, GPT-Index) and vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)Responsibilities: Understand core functional problems, identify contemporary solutions, and lead development and productionization of those solutions Contribute to and advocate for design, implementation, and maintenance of reliable cloud infrastructure for machine learning applications, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD best practices.\nEnsure best practices for ML SDLC and ML Ops are implemented Architect and implement ML algorithms and solutions to improve our software and user experiences Stay abreast of ML trends, support the deployment of advanced internal services, and help develop reusable libraries for the Machine Learning Platform. Objectives: State of the art ML models for variant interpretation, knowledge, and reasoning tools are leveraged in production in collaboration with our application engineering teams Implementation ML infrastructure for rapid development, deployment, and scaling of machine learning models Improved efficiency and reliability of machine learning workflows~Science - Minded, Patient - Focused. At GeneDx, we create, follow, and are informed by cutting-edge science. With over 20 years of expertise in diagnosing rare disorders and diseases, and pioneering work in the identification of new disease-causing genes, our commitment to genetic disease detection, discovery, and diagnosis is based on sound science and is focused on enhancing patient care.Experts In What Matters Most.With hundreds of genetic counselors, MD/PhD scientists, and clinical and molecular genomics specialists on staff, we are the industry's genetic testing experts and proud of it. We share the same goal as healthcare providers, patients, and families: to provide clear, accurate, and meaningful answers we all can trust.SEQUENCING HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES. From sequencing to reporting and beyond, our technical and clinical experts are providing guidance every step of the way:TECHNICAL EXPERTISEHigh-quality testing: Our laboratory is CLIA certified and CAP accredited and most of our tests are also New York State approved. Advanced detection: By interrogating genes for complex variants, we can identify the underlying causes of conditions that may otherwise be missed. CLINICAL EXPERTISEThorough analysis: We classify variants according to our custom adaptation of the most recent guidelines. We then leverage our rich internal database for additional interpretation evidence. Customized care: Our experts review all test results and write reports in a clear, concise, and personalized way. We also include information for research studies in specific clinical situations. Impactful discovery: Our researchers continue working to find answers even after testing is complete. Through both internal research efforts and global collaborations, we have identified and published hundreds of new disease-gene relationships and developed novel tools for genomic data analysis. These efforts ultimately deliver more diagnostic findings to individuals.

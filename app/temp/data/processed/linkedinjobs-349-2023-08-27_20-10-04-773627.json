They dreamed of networks that could secure themselves without human intervention or rely on expensive hardware.Today, Netography has made that vision a reality with the cloud's power & flexibility. We're helping companies gain visibility into on-premises, cloud & hybrid network environments to eliminate blind spots and an added security layer that does not rely on signatures to remediate threats. By assessing threats in the cloud, we can detect, route, or block bad traffic at a scale and ease never before possible.Salary Expectations$ 160,000- $190,000What We OfferEmployer paid medical benefitsUnlimited PTOStock OptionsInclusive environment that fosters creative problem solvingThe capability to work remotely\nShow more\nShow less\nSeniority level\nMid-Senior level\nEmployment type\nFull-time\nJob function\nEngineering and Information Technology\nIndustries\nTechnology, Information and Internet\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at Netography by 2x\nSee who you know\nGet notified about new Platform Engineer jobs in Annapolis, MD.\nSign in to create job alert\nLooking for a job?\nVisit the Career Advice Hub to see tips on interviewing and resume writing.\nView Career Advice Hub\nLinkedIn\n\u00a9 2023\nAbout\nAccessibility\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nYour California Privacy Choices\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Policy\nBrand Policy\nGuest Controls\nCommunity Guidelines\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 (Arabic)\n\u010ce\u0161tina (Czech)\nDansk (Danish)\nDeutsch (German)\nEnglish (English)\nEspa\u00f1ol (Spanish)\nFran\u00e7ais (French)\n\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nBahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\nItaliano (Italian)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 (Korean)\nBahasa Malaysia (Malay)\nNederlands (Dutch)\nNorsk (Norwegian)\nPolski (Polish)\nPortugu\u00eas (Portuguese)\nRom\u00e2n\u0103 (Romanian)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (Russian)\nSvenska (Swedish)\n\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 (Thai)\nTagalog (Tagalog)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (Turkish)\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 (Ukrainian)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Simplified))\n\u6b63\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Traditional))\nLanguage\nCreate job alert\nGet email updates for new Platform Engineer jobs in Annapolis, MD\nDismiss\nBy creating this job alert, you agree to the LinkedIn User Agreement and Privacy Policy.
